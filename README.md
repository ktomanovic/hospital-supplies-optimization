- Dataset: hospital_supply_chain
- Author: [vanpatangan on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vanpatangan/hospital-supply-chain)
- Description: This dataset includes simulated hospital supply and usage data, used to explore forecasting, optimization, and redistribution strategies.
  
Description
This project uses machine learning to forecast the minimum required stock of key hospital supplies such as gloves, masks, and IV drips. 
The current model identifies trends and seasonality in usage and prepares the foundation for optimizing stock redistribution between departments.

Tools Used
